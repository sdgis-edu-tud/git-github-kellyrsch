To interpret the clustering results, we examine the centers of each cluster in the original data scale. The table below shows the (unscaled) clustered values of each attribute with their standard deviation.

| Type | B1uses | B3ndvi | CA1temp | QL2acg | Description |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | 0.417 ($\sigma$ = 0.36) 🟠 | 0.742 ($\sigma$ = 0.19) 🔴 | 0.778 ($\sigma$ = 0.09) 🔴 | 0.708 ($\sigma$ = 0.24) 🔴 | High B3ndvi, CA1temp, and QL2acg. Low B1uses. |
| 2 | 0.747 ($\sigma$ = 0.33) 🔴 | 0.300 ($\sigma$ = 0.27) 🟡 | 0.386 ($\sigma$ = 0.12) 🟡 | 7.216e-16 ($\sigma$ = 0.00) 🟣 | High B1uses and extremely low QL2acg |
| 3 | 0.781 ($\sigma$ = 0.32) 🔴 | 0.286 ($\sigma$ = 0.19) 🟢 | 0.442 ($\sigma$ = 0.16) 🟠 | 0.792 ($\sigma$ = 0.07) 🔴 | High B1uses and QL2acg, low B3ndvi |
| 4 | 0.545 ($\sigma$ = 0.41) 🟠 | 0.301 ($\sigma$ = 0.14) 🟡 | 0.837 ($\sigma$ = 0.10) 🔴 | 0.0177 ($\sigma$ = 0.11) 🔵 | High CA1temp and very low QL2acg |

The mean distance to cluster center for the four clusters is shown in the table below together with the number of geometries in each cluster. 

| Type | Mean Distance | Number of geometries | 
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1    | 1.260         | 125                  |
| 2    | 1.264         | 139                  |
| 3    | 1.169         | 117                  |
| 4    | 1.173         | 110                  |

All four clusters have just about the same level of accuracy, based on the mean distances to the cluster centers. However, when looking at the standard deviations of the different attributes per cluster, we can conclude that the distinctiveness of the clusters is not very high. Especially the B1uses attribute has high standard deviations and the different clusters therefore do not say much about the typology considering this attribute. 

Eventhough, we managed to combine some characteristics of each cluster to define distinct typologies and come up with strategies of urban stream development for each.
